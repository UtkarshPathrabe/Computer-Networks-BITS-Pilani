Question  
--------  
What makes computing device autonomous in the sense that it could qualify as a Network Node?  
* Device's own Processor  
* Device's own Primary Memory / Storage  
* Device's own Secondary Storage  
* Device's own Communication Interface  
* A combination of Device's own Processor and primary Memory / Storage  
* A Cobination of Device's own Primary and Secondary Storage  
* None of these  

### Answer  
A combination of Device's own Processor and primary Memory / Storage  

### Explanation  
In order to be called an autonomous computing element in this sense, the minimum a device must have is its own processing capability (that would involve processor and RAM at the least) and not working as a 'slave' to any other device.
