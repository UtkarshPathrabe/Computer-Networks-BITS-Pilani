Quiz 03
=======  

Question 01
-----------  
Which provides a better way to represent exchange of messages / data units between two given network nodes running the same Network Protocol?  

### Answer  
Timing and Sequence Diagram.  

Question 02
-----------  
Why is it important to ensure that every defined state is reachable in a State Transition Diagram representing a Network Protocol?  

### Answer  
All the other three points apply.  

### Explanation  
The three points are:
* To ensure that the Network Protocol has all desired and possible states as well as stimuli leading to those states indicated.  
* No defined / possible state has a path leading to it and a stimulus that could cause a transition from a prior state to a given state.  
* To ensure that the protocol can handle all possible / likely errors.  

Question 03
-----------  
What is the primary flaw of the the last version of the hypothetical Stop and Wait Protocol evolved in the last class?  

### Answer  
It can neither handle lost ACK nor it is efficient.  

Question 04
-----------  
The protocol developed in the last class assumes only two nodes involved in transaction. If three or more nodes have to be involved with direct and indirect links, which modification would make the most important design consideration?  

### Answer  
Each packet would need to have a new field to be added to identify sender and receiver.  

Question 05
-----------  
A Stateless protocol:  

### Answer  
Does not record / store state information corresponding to any transactionDoes not record / store state information corresponding to any transaction.
